# Automated GitHub + Vercel Setup Using MCP Tools

Since you have GitHub MCP connectors available, here's a better automated approach:

## Option 1: Use GitHub MCP Tools Directly (Recommended)

I can automatically:
1. **Create the GitHub repository** using `mcp_github_create_repository`
2. **Push all files** using `mcp_github_push_files` (single commit)
3. **Set up repository settings**

Then you just need to:
1. Import to Vercel (it will auto-detect from GitHub)
2. Add environment variables
3. Deploy!

## Option 2: Manual Push with Better Structure

If you prefer to push manually, the repo is already set up with:
- âœ… `.gitignore` configured
- âœ… `vercel.json` for auto-detection
- âœ… All code organized and ready

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Initialize git (if not already)
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Castaway Council PWA"

# Create GitHub repo (or use MCP tools)
# Then push:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/castaway-council.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## What Would You Prefer?

**A)** I'll use GitHub MCP tools to create the repo and push everything automatically
**B)** You'll push manually, and I'll guide you through Vercel setup
**C)** Something else?

The GitHub MCP approach is fastest - I can have your repo live in seconds! ðŸš€
